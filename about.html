                <p>Hello there,</p>
                <p>I'm so glad to meet you.</p>
                <p>I'm Pravanjan Patnaik, but you can call me Prav.
                    I build exciting <b>B2B digital products and games</b> that people actually love using.</p>
                <p> For the past 17 years, I've been helping startups turn their wild ideas
                    into reality - helping them raise over $20M along the way.
                    When my clients invest $1 with us, they typically see $10 back.</p>
                <p>
                    Some cool stuff I was part of:


                <ul>
                    <li>Being part of the World Design Organization (WDO) - where some of the world's
                        best designers hang out</li>
                    <li>Judging Glocha's climate change platform (backed by UN-Habitat)</li>
                    <li>
                        Getting featured in ResearchGate for figuring out some clever zero-waste
                        management solutions</li>

                    <li>

                        Have worked with brands like ITC, Bayer, World Remit and Weill Cornell Medicine
                    </li>

                </ul>

                </p>
                <p>
                    I lead an amazing team that handles everything from massive projects
                    to ongoing support work for a wide range of clients, from tiny startups
                    to the companies on the Forbes Top 10 list.</p>
                <p>I truly believe the most exciting breakthroughs come from the unexpected
                    (Unknown - Unknown).</p>
                <p> That's why I love pushing boundaries and trying unconventional approaches.</p>
                <p>
                    My core skill set lies in vertical SaaS, Digital Twin technologies in B2B,
                    and Product Design.
                </p>
                <p>I learned what works and what doesn't through both my failures
                    and those of my clients.</p>

                <p>I believe we're in this wild era where even tiny teams can
                    build massive businesses. It's all about being smart with data
                    and letting AI do its magic.</p>

                <p>I'm kind of obsessed with thinking about ‚Äúthinking‚Äù (iykyk üëÄ).</p>
                <p>This fascination has driven me to delve deeply into the
                    complexities of human decision-making, even leading me
                    to secure the trademark for "Human Decision" in India.</p>

                <p>It's really nice to meet you.</p>
                <p> I'm looking forward to getting to know you better.</p>
                <p>See you soon,</p>
